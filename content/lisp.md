# Overview
LISt Processing (Lisp) is a deceptively interesting language. I first experienced the language in my early undergrad days. Scheme was the reference language for SICP. Lisp is seen as an extremely simple (syntactically) language that directly translates into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This makes it easy to get started as there's very little syntax, and easy to build your own language implementation (compiler, interpreter, etc.).
Unfortunately, at the time I was learning, I had already invested myself so deeply into C++ that I immediately dismissed the language for its obtuse syntax and lack of obvious accessors, classes, and all the usual OOP features of the time.

Over time though, the allure of OOP has worn off. Promises were broken, things change. Lisp remains and while common-lisp and scheme have experienced a decline in popularity, Lisp continues to live on in other forms such as Clojure.

## What makes it so appealing?
Lisp is appealing in its many forms due to how simple it is to get started. It is a mindset shift in the sense that while you have a syntax, compiler/interpreter, and standard library, you are basically forming your own type of syntax for a program which you then use to execute what you want to accomplish. It's hard to describe without experiencing it, and my usage is still too limited to properly explain. I'll make a follow-up post when I better understand.
